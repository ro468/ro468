üëã Hi, I'm Rohini!
I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Data Analyst with a strong foundation in AI/ML and Natural Language Processing (NLP). With over 5 years of experience at Apple and Amazon, I‚Äôve worked on large-scale data collection, AI model optimization, and data analysis to drive impactful decisions. Currently, I'm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Data Science to deepen my knowledge and contribute to data-driven solutions in innovative ways.  

üöÄ What I‚Äôm Working On:

NLP Projects: Developing advanced sentiment analysis models, RAG-based Q&A systems, and experimenting with large language models (LLMs) for enhanced data processing and insights extraction.  
Data Analytics Projects: Working on projects that involve data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization, and predictive modeling, like my work analyzing medical costs and Airbnb listings.  
AI & ML: Applying machine learning techniques such as classification, clustering, and neural networks to build models that predict trends and optimize processes across multiple domains.  

üå± What I‚Äôm Learning:  

Generative AI: Delving deeper into generative models and their applications in NLP and beyond.  
Prompt Engineering: Sharpening my skills in designing effective prompts for LLMs and other AI models to enhance their output.  
Data Engineering: Expanding my knowledge in big data technologies like PySpark and Cassandra, and improving my expertise in data pipelines and ETL processes.  

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:  

Languages: Python, SQL, R, JavaScript  
Tools & Libraries: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Hugging Face, LangChain, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Tableau, Power BI  
Platforms: AWS, Google Cloud, Docker, GitHub, Microsoft Office Suite  

üåü Professional Experience Highlights:  

Apple (AI/ML Data Analyst):  
Led large-scale data collection for Siri, Dictation, and other Apple products, focusing on improving entity recognition and enhancing voice assistant features through high-quality data processes.
Automated data reporting, reducing reporting time by 30% and improving the efficiency of data annotation workflows by 97%.  

Amazon (Data Analyst):  
Conducted customer sentiment analysis and data audits, improving customer satisfaction and reducing errors by 20%.  
Utilized SQL and Excel for data modeling and streamlining operational processes, leading to a 15% improvement in overall efficiency.  

üìö Academic Projects:  
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Q&A System: Built a high-accuracy Q&A system using Hugging Face models and LangChain for effective data retrieval and NLP tasks.  
AI Text Detection Model: Developed a model to identify AI-generated text using techniques like DistilBERT and Random Forest.  
Medical Cost Interpretation: Conducted predictive modeling on healthcare cost data to provide insights into cost drivers and trends.  
Airbnb Listings Analysis in NYC: Created interactive data visualizations to analyze pricing trends and spatial data, providing insights into the Airbnb market.
